"""The A2A discovery card: what this agent can be asked to do, in one machine-readable place.

Served at ``/.well-known/agent-card.json`` and registrable with agent-registry (rule R4). The card
is built from the SAME tool table the runtime binds, so an agent cannot advertise a skill it does
not implement or implement one it never advertises; ``tests/unit/test_agent_surface.py`` fails the
build when the two disagree.

Pure: domain types and stdlib only, no ADK and no cloud SDK, so the card can be generated and
inspected offline.
